Sends email notifications to users (post author or site administrator) when the status of a post is changed. Supports custom post types.

== Description ==
If you have a multi-author blog or your website receives a lot of guest post submissions then this plugin will help you inform your users when their posts get published or rejected. Not only that but you can also send notifications to blog owner or to a list of email addresses. It has a really simple interface (Settings > Status Change Notifications) using which you can create as many notifications as you like.

Here's how this plugin is different from its counterparts:

**Unlimited Notifications:** When it comes to creating notifications, it doesn't put any restrictions on you. You can create notifications for whichever status transitions you like for instance draft to published, pending to published, draft to pending and so on. You can also send separate emails to the post author and the blog administrator.

**Custom Post Types:** Want to send a different email for each custom post type? We've got you covered. Just create a new notification in the backend control panel.

**HTML Emails:** You can choose whether to send emails in plain text or HTML format. Moreover, you can change the sender name and sender email so that your emails look more professional and leave a better impact on readers.

If you like the plugin and want to help please leave a good review in the feedback section.
