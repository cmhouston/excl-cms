Adminimize is a WordPress plugin that lets you hide 'unnecessary' items from the WordPress backend and many many more ...

== Description ==
Visually compresses the administratrive header so that more admin page content can be initially seen. Also moves 'Dashboard' onto the main administrative menu because having it sit in the tip-top black bar was ticking me off and many other changes in the edit-area. Adminimize is a WordPress plugin that lets you hide 'unnecessary' items from the WordPress administration menu, submenu and even the 'Dashboard', with forwarding to the Manage-page. On top of that, you can also hide post meta controls on the Write page and other areas in the admin-area and Write-page, so as to simplify the editing interface. Compatible with WordPress 2.5 or later. 
Configure all metaboxes and other areas in the write-area. The new theme move the Tags- and Categorys-box to the sidebar, switch off optional metaboxes and other areas in the write-area. Many options for menu, submenu and all areas, metaboxes in the write-area, separated for all roles in WordPress.

= Support Custom Options on all different post types =
With version 1.6.1 it is possible to add own options for hide areas in the backend of WordPress. It is easy and you must only forgive ID or class of the tag. Also it is possible to use a fixed menu and header.

= Support Custom Post Type =
Also it is possible with version 1.7.18 to use on custom post types; hide 'unnecessary' areas on the custom post types for different roles and post types.

= Compatibility with the plugins for MetaBoxes in Write-area =
1. You can add your own options, you must only see for css selectors

= Requirements =
1. WordPress version 2.8 and later

= What does this plugin do? =
The plugin changes the administration backend and gives you the power to assign rights on certain parts. Admins can activate/deactivate every part of the menu and even parts of the submenu. Meta fields can be administered separately for posts and pages. Certain parts of the write menu can be deactivated separately for admins or non-admins. The header of the backend is minimized and optimized to give you more space and the structure of the menu gets changed to make it more logical - this can all be done per user so each user can have his own settings.

= Details =
1. the admin theme can be set per user. To change this go to user settings
1. currently you can use the theme together with the color settings for the Fresh and Classic themes
1. more colors can be easily added
1. new menu structure: on the left hand site you find classic menu points for managing and writing, while the right part is reserved for settings, design, plugins and user settings
1. the dashboard has been moved into the menu itself but this can be deactivated if its not desired
1. the menu is now smaller and takes up less space
1. the WRITE menu has been changed as follows:
1. it is no longer limited to a fixed width but flows to fill your whole browser window now
1. you can scroll all input fields now, no need to make certain parts of the WRITE screen bigger
1. categories moved to the sidebar
1. tags moved to the sidebar if you are not using the plugin "Simple Tags"
1. the editing part gets auto-scrolled which makes sense when using a small resolution
1. the media uploader now uses the whole screen width
1. supports the plugin "Admin Drop Down Menu" - when the plugin is active the user has two more backend-themes to chose from
1. supports the plugin "Lighter Menus" - when that plugin is active the user has another two backend-themes to chose from
1. two new color schemes are now available
1. the width of the sidebar is changeable to standard, 300px, 400px or 30%
1. each meta field can now be deactivated (per user setting) so it doesn't clutter up your write screen
1. you can even deactivate other parts like h2, messages or the info in the sidebar
1. the part of the user info you have on the upper - right part of your menu can be deactivated or just the log-out link
1. the dashboard can be completely removed from the backend
1. all menu and sub menu points can be completely deactivated for admins and non-admins
1. most of these changes are only loaded when needed - i.e. only in the write screen
1. set a backend-theme for difficult user
1. you can set an role to view the areas on link page, edit post, edit page and global
1. you can add own options for set rights to role
1. it is possible to disable HTML-Editor on edit-area, only Visual-tab
1. remove widgets in widgets settings for different role
1. remove admin bar for different role
1. remove admin bar items for different role
1. remove items on custom post types for different role
1. ... many many more
